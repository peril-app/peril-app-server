# Peril App Server

*The open source server hosting solution for the Peril App.*

## What is peril?

Peril is an app based off of the TV show game "Jeopardy" (hence the synonym "peril"). This app tries to emulate the Jeopardy experience with customizability so that users can upload any types of trivia that they want. This originally started as a concept for a language learning app; however, we decided that catering to more audiences than just language learners would benefit more people.

## Is this really free?

Yep! As long as you host it yourself. If you want to use a pre-hosted version, then check back in a bit, because we have a pay-as-you-go version that will be hosted in the cloud coming soon!

## How do I build the server?

1.] `git clone https://github.com/peril-app/peril-app-server && cd peril-app-server/src`

2.] `sudo ./build.sh` (sit back, as this may take a little while since you are building everything from source!)

## How do I run the server?

***Instructions pending as the application is not complete. Please check back later!***
